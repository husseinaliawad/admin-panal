ðŸ”§ Manual Fix Steps via cPanel File Manager
===========================================

1. LOGIN TO CPANEL
   - Go to your hosting control panel
   - Open File Manager
   - Navigate to: /public_html/

2. CHECK CURRENT STRUCTURE
   - Look for folder: storage/app/public/brands/
   - Check if public/storage exists (should NOT exist as folder)

3. CREATE SYMBOLIC LINK
   Option A: If Terminal is available in File Manager
   - Open Terminal
   - Run: ln -s ../storage/app/public public/storage
   
   Option B: Manual creation
   - Delete public/storage if it exists as folder
   - Create new folder: public/storage
   - Inside public/storage, create symbolic link to: ../../storage/app/public

4. SET PERMISSIONS
   - Right-click on storage folder â†’ Permissions â†’ 775
   - Right-click on bootstrap/cache â†’ Permissions â†’ 775
   - Right-click on public/storage â†’ Permissions â†’ 775

5. TEST IMAGES
   Test these URLs in browser:
   - https://completitcompservice.de/storage/brands/apple.jpg
   - https://completitcompservice.de/storage/brands/samsung.jpg
   - https://completitcompservice.de/images-/logo.jpg

6. CLEAR CACHE (if possible)
   Create a file clear-cache.php with:
   <?php
   exec('php artisan config:clear');
   exec('php artisan route:clear');
   exec('php artisan view:clear');
   echo "Cache cleared!";
   ?>
   
   Run: https://completitcompservice.de/clear-cache.php

7. VERIFY WEBSITE
   - Go to: https://completitcompservice.de
   - Check if "Browse Popular Brands" images are loading

ALTERNATIVE SOLUTION:
====================
If symbolic links don't work, copy the entire contents of:
storage/app/public/brands/
TO:
public/storage/brands/

This creates a physical copy instead of a symbolic link.

CONTACT HOSTING SUPPORT:
========================
If none of the above works, contact your hosting provider about:
1. SSH access issues (/sbin/nologin error)
2. Symbolic link support
3. Storage link creation for Laravel applications
